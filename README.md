4 STEPS QUICKSTART for raspberry pi LAMP server.
Setup LAMP server using the following instructions, stop before installing the Wordpress software, we are not using it.
Create a database(I called it maindb) in the main folder, import sql/database.sql and sql/dummy.sql.
Change the database settings in lib/core.php(already done for this project, update for you own use.)
Launch index.php in your browser.
