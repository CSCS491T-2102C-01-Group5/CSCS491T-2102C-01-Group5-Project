Now that they''ve indulged in a bit of ""full-frontal snogging,"" Georgia turns her attention to advancing the relationship. But things quickly go wrong when she learns that her father''s new job may necessitate a move to New Zealand. Crestfallen, Georgia feels her life might as well be over. Then, miraculously, the dreaded move is cancelled, and things seem to be getting better -- at least until 17-year-old Robbie decides to break up with Georgia because he''s bothered by the difference in their ages. Borrowing freely from her mum''s closet and advice books, even as she''s steadfastly discounting everything her mum says, a crushed but determined Georgia comes up with a scheme to win Robbie back. As usual, nothing goes as planned, and life is further complicated by Georgia''s temperamental cat, Angus (who''s having a few amorous leanings of his own), and her baby sister, Libby, whose fascination with (and lack of control over) her bodily functions leads to several intriguing mishaps. Of course, there are other disasters, too: a quick-tan lotion that turns Georgia''s legs orange, a run-in with the aptly named Bummer sisters, and friends who insist on focusing on their own problems from time to time.Who knew the angst of adolescence could be so much fun? This Georgia''s-eye view of teenage life is wonderfully egocentric and side-splittingly funny. And despite the occasional language barrier (a glossary of terms is provided in the back of the book), Georgia''s thoughts and experiences will prove universally recognizable to anyone who is, or has ever been, a teenager. --Beth Amos"', 'Hardcover', '243', 'HarperTeen', '402014.jpg', '3.49'),

But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz: a month later she was dead at the age of thirty-nine. Two years earlier, living in a small village in central France, where she, her husband, and their two small daughters had fled in a vain attempt to elude the Nazis, she''d begun her novel, a luminous portrayal of a human drama in which she herself would become a victim. When she was arrested, she had completed two parts of the epic, the handwritten manuscripts of which were hidden in a suitcase that her daughters would take with them into hiding and eventually into freedom. Sixty-four years later, at long last, we can read Namirovsky''s literary masterpiece The first part, "A Storm in June," opens in the chaos of the massive 1940 exodus from Paris on the eve of the Nazi invasion during which several families and individuals are thrown together under circumstances beyond their control. They share nothing but the harsh demands of survival, some trying to maintain lives of privilege, others struggling simply to preserve their lives, but soon, all together, they will be forced to face the awful exigencies of physical and emotional displacement, and the annihilation of the world they know. In the second part, "Dolce," we enter the increasingly complex life of a German-occupied provincial village. Coexisting uneasily with the soldiers billeted among them, the villagers, from aristocrats to shopkeepers to peasants, cope as best they can. Some choose resistance, others collaboration, and as their community is transformed by these acts, the lives of these these men and women reveal nothing less than the very essence of humanity.Suite Francaise is a singularly piercing evocation, at once subtle and severe, deeply compassionate, and fiercely ironic, of life and death in occupied France, and a brilliant, profoundly moving work of art.', 'Paperback', '431', 'Vintage', '43944._SY475_.jpg', '2.76'),
